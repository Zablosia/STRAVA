# Strava Activity Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

This Streamlit application provides a comprehensive analytics dashboard for Strava activities, enabling athletes and fitness enthusiasts to gain deeper insights into their training patterns and performance metrics. The app connects to the Strava API to fetch user activity data and presents it through interactive visualizations and comparative analyses.

### Target Audience

This dashboard serves athletes, coaches, and fitness enthusiasts who seek data-driven insights to optimize their training. It bridges the gap between raw Strava data and actionable performance intelligence.

## Unique Value Proposition

Unlike basic activity trackers, this dashboard transforms workout data into strategic insights through comparative analysis, percentile rankings, and trend visualization, enabling users to make informed decisions about their training progression.


## Strong Points

1. **Real-time Data Integration**: Direct connection to Strava API with automatic token refresh mechanism ensures always up-to-date activity data.

2. **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: 
   - Individual activity performance ranking against historical data
   - Period-over-period comparisons with percentage change calculations
   - Percentile-based performance radar charts for quick visual assessment

3. **Interactive Filtering**: Dynamic filtering by activity type and year allows focused analysis of specific training modalities.

4. **Comprehensive Metrics Coverage**: Tracks essential performance indicators including speed, distance, elevation, heart rate, and duration.

5. **Clean Visualization**: Utilizes Plotly for interactive, professional-grade charts that are both informative and visually appealing.


## Room for Improvement

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
   - Add data persistence layer for offline functionality
   - Optimize large dataset handling with lazy loading

2. **Enhanced Analytics**:
   - Add training load calculations (TSS, CTL, ATL)
   - Implement trend analysis and performance predictions
   - Include weather data correlation
   - Add segment/route-specific analysis

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add export functionality for reports (PDF/CSV)
   - Implement custom date range selections beyond weekly comparisons
   - Add activity filtering by additional parameters (distance ranges, routes, etc.)
   - Include mobile-responsive design optimizations

4. **Data Validation**:
   - Add error handling for API failures
   - Implement data quality checks and outlier detection
   - Handle edge cases for missing metrics
